Just host wgscraper.php locally and hit it with a ?src= param specifying
a URL to an image:

    http://localhost/wgscraper.php?src=www.somesite.com/path/to/your/file


It'll show you your image and print some basic color analysis like:

    Width: 1920px
    Height: 1200px
    [Mostly] red pixels: 164 (10368390 combined value in all pixels)
    [Mostly] green pixels: 0 (159882217 combined value in all pixels)
    [Mostly] blue pixels: 2269158 (466221921 combined value in all pixels)
    [Pure] black pixels: 0 (0 combined value in all pixels)
    [Pure] white pixels: 6857 (1748535 combined value in all pixels)
    Dominant color: Blue
